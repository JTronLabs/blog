introduction: |
  [Phaser](http://phaser.io/) is an open source, 2D game engine written for JavaScript. It is robust and easy to learn with active [development](https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser). Make your JS game for modern browsers and use frameworks like [Cordova](https://cordova.apache.org/), [PhoneGap](http://phonegap.com/), or [CocconJS](https://www.ludei.com/cocoonjs/) to download and run it on multiple operating systems (learn how to do this [here]()). In this tutorial series I'll cover how to use Phaser to create a simple game from inception to the play store, and along the way write maintainable code. To preview what we'll accomplish you can see the [code](https://github.com/JTronLabs/Birdu), play the [game](http://jtronlabs.github.io/Birdu/game/dist/index.html), or download it off the [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jtronlabs.birdu).

Regardless of your current skill level, Phaser is a great choice to develop your next (or first) game. One of its greatest strengths is the [documentation](http://phaser.io/docs/2.4.7/index) and available tutorials. The [offical tutorials](http://phaser.io/learn/official-tutorials), [community tutorials](http://phaser.io/learn/community-tutorials), and [specific examples](http://phaser.io/examples) give this engine a low learning curve, ultimately making your game quicker (and cheaper) to make. Phaser is not as powerful as AAA game engines like [Unity](https://unity3d.com/) or [UnrealEngine](https://www.unrealengine.com/) as it lacks 3D ([BabylonJS can do 3D though](http://www.babylonjs.com/)), a GUI, support staff, and it is not as well known, but it is 100% free. Whether you're an established business or an aspiring indie, using a free engine could add a lot of money to your pockets throughout your game's life.

Unlike writing native apps, Phaser does not lock you into one device. At the end of this series I use Cordova to publish on the Google Play Store, gaining access to a greater audience. These frameworks allow you to write once and publish multiple times, saving precious dev time. Unfortunately this process is a bit more involved than using AAA engines, but again it is free. Unfortuantely, apps written in this manner are less efficient than native apps, as they require a [WebView](https://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/latest/guide/overview/index.html#architecture) to run in the background and interpret the JS like a browser would. Usually for small apps this performance hit is minimal, and far preferable to having to re-write all the code multiple times.

At first glance, the simplest way to setup a game would be to have an index.html page and two external  
<code class=" language-markup">&#60;script&#62;</code> tags for including phaser.js and game.js files. That game.js file would be huge and unwieldy, likely hard to step through and debug. I prefer small, [modular](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_programming) files that have a clearly defined purpose. Instead maybe create a bunch of small JS files and link them together. So instead of just game.js, you'd have mario.js, koopa.js, block.js,settings.js and so on. But that creates the issue of organizing and ensuring proper link ordering/dependencies. To get the best of both worlds we will use a generator, enabling us to write focused files and automatically linking them together. It will also provide a standardized code scaffold when we create new files.

You can view our generator [here](https://github.com/codevinsky/generator-phaser-official). It supports automatic generation of a new game, game 'states', and game 'prefabs'. These will be covered more later, but essentially a state is a screen on your game (welcome menu, gameplay, settings, e.g.) and a prefab is a game entity (mario, koopa e.g.). This tool is built on [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/) (and thus [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)), which means you will need to install these dependencies.

{% highlight bash %}

#Install generator dependencies. Install npm, then bower, then yo (in order to run our generator-phaser-official)
sudo apt-get install nodejs #Web server
sudo apt-get install npm #The NodeJS package manager
npm install -g --save-dev bower #package manager
npm install -g --save-dev yo #client-side dev stack, helps devs quickly build high quality web apps
npm install -g --save-dev grunt-cli #task-based command line build tool for JavaScript projects. 'save-dev' adds grunt as a dev-dependency to package.json

sudo npm install -g yo generator-phaser-official #Desired YeoMan tool to auto-gen phaser game project

{% endhighlight %}


Now that we have our dependencies installed, we can generate our game:


{% highlight bash %}

mkdir ~/Documents/birdu
cd ~/Documents/birdu
yo phaser-official #Generate a project in current directory. Will download Phaser and node dependencies.
#If a phaser-official project already exists in current dir, then option choices don't matter. Just choose to not overwrite your files
#name of game is 'birdu'
#Phaser version is 2.4.7 (at time of writing)
#use 800x600 screen resolution
grunt build #compile JS files and save production output to '/dist' directory

{% endhighlight %}

This Phaser game generator uses [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com) to compile your assets and code into a working game. When you first run and build with this generator, there will be a playable game called 'Click the Yeoman Logo' generated at 'dist/index.html'. You can look under 'game/states' to get an understanding of how this sample game is built with Phaser.

{% highlight bash %}

If you're using Git for version control I recommended adding a .gitignore file of the auto-generated folders:

{% highlight bash %}
#.gitignore
node_modules/
bower_components/
dist/
